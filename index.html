              I am an India based Web - Developer focused on crafting clean and user-friendly experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
              Although I am a B-Tech. graduate, yet I call myself a student because one can never stop learning. You will always find me researching and learning new things. Currently, I am trying my hands on ES6 and JS Framework Vue.
          </p>
         <p>
          I have learned developing <strong> Web - Applications using PHP </strong> during my college days <i>(Goshh! those days were so awesome!) </i> and <strong> PHP Framework - Codeigniter,</strong> during my internship days. <i>(Days that told me what a corporate life looks like!)</i><br><br>
          Since business is important, take a look at <strong><a href="work.html">Projects</a></strong> I have developed.
         </p>
         <p>
          Apart from writing code, I enjoy Travelling. Maybe, that's from where all the motivation comes from. And on those gloomy days, when I am not ready to give my 100%, you will find me scribbling down my thoughts on my phone <i>(you can't always carry pen and paper with you!),</i> some of which you can read on my <a href="#ss">Instagram</a>.
           </p>
         <p>
           Feel free to <a href="mailto:shivanjali012@gmail.com"><strong>reach</strong></a> me, either to hire or for a cup of coffee! (Yep! I prefer coffee over Chai!).
